## RESTful API endpoints

*GET questions*

```
https://bronzies.com/api/questions
```

*GET highscore*

```
https://bronzies.com/api/highscore
```

*POST highscore*

```
https://bronzies.com/api/highscore
```

_The newly added entry will have an aditional key to id it: `justadded: true`_

(use: `curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name": "Superman","nays": 55,"score": 5555555,"date": 777}' http://localhost:5555/highscore`)

## Run the build

```shell
yarn
yarn start
```

## Run web app

Navigate your browser to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

## Run the server

*Run mongoDB*

```shell
mongod
```

*Run RESTful API*

```shell
node prod/node/api.min.js
```

## Install on server

The API runs behind an [NGINX proxy](https://github.com/dominikwilkowski/bronzies/blob/master/bronzies.com).
In case the server has to reboot we need a way to start it up so let's create a cron task:

### CRON task

To make sure the blender is started when the system has to reboot, make sure you add a cron task after reboot:

```shell
chmod 700 /www/bronzies/node/starter.sh #the starter.sh of this repo
crontab -e
```

and add:

```shell
@reboot /www/bronzies/node/starter.sh
```

### FOREVER node deamon

Now we still have to make sure the node app is restarted if it crashes for some uncaught reason. Install [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) and
register the task:

```shell
npm i forever -g
forever start -l blender.log --append -o blenderOut.log -e blenderError.log server.js
```
